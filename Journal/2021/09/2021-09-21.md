- New coffee: [[Brazil Cerrado]] from [[Les Bruleries]]. This is a coffee I really enjoyed the first time (not so much the second time). 14g [[Comandante]] => delightfully malty aroma upon grinding and [[Meh]] taste, as there is a slight [[Lemony]] undertones with insufficient [[Dark Chocolate]] notes. This seems to be medium roast.

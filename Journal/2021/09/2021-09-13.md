- Following lowish [[Water Temperature]], another good cup of coffee. Instead of relying on a thermometer, I'm following the whistle sound commencement, and then turn off the stove, letting the water in my stovetop [[Kettle]] stabilize while I grind the coffee. Once this becomes a habit, I would not strictly need to buy a (bulky) variable-temperature measuring kettle (like the Fellow Stagg), though it would be nice to have for experimentation.

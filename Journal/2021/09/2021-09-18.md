- Decided to redial the [[Comandante]], and found that it was dialed in at 15 when I thought it was at 12. Which is pretty strange ... and maybe a [[Fault]] (either in the grinder or in my memory). At least, so far I've not been making [[1850 Midnight Gold]] at the intended grind size. Redialled to grind 13 (rest the same - 15g; 150g) today. Less [[Lemony]] (about same as 16th, however), some new crema, still [[Meh]].

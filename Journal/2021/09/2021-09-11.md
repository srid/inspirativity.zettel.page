- Same coffee, but this time (~8PM now) by accident I ended up using colder than usual water for [[Aeropress]] (I could feel the lack of heat on first sip). Surprisingly there was a more pronounced coffee-y taste (chocolate-y/ nutty) (ie. little to none of that sour/bitter crap that makes drinking coffee resemble humdrum). Maybe water temperature matters more than I had thought, and that it may be worth investing in a variable-temperature kettle? Evidently, the ==best tasting== [[Espresso Italien]] so far.

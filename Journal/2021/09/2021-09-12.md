- [[Fault]]: Had another [[Aeropress]] water leak. What actually happens is this: as I near the end stage of pushing, the remaining water -- instead of being *pushed down* -- *lifts up* through the plunger rubber. This indicates to me that the plunger is not sealing properly with the interior walls of Aeropress. Replace Aeropress, or get a new plunger?

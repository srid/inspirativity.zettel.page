- [[Fault]]: Had another [[Aeropress]] water leak. What actually happens is this: as I near the end stage of pushing, the remaining water -- instead of being *pushed down* -- *lifts up* through the plunger rubber. This indicates to me that the plunger is not sealing properly with the interior walls of Aeropress. Replace Aeropress, or get a new plunger?

    > The AeroPress instructions advise against storing the seal inside the chamber because holding the seal compressed inside the chamber eventually will reduce the size of the seal, enabling coffee to leak around it. --[Aeropress FAQ](https://aeropress.com/faq/as-i-push-my-plunger-down-some-coffee-leaks-through-the-rubber-seal-and-ends-up-in-the-hollow-interior-of-the-plunger-how-does-it-get-past-the-seal-the-plunger-is-stored-inside-the-main-part-and-it/) [[Fault]]

    Uhh, so that's what I should avoid.

- Trying [[Aeropress/Inverted Method]] for [[Yirgacheffe]] and increased [[Comandante]] grind dial to 18 (from 15) (assuming I remember the last one correctly; see the [[2021-09-18]] misdial note), and the taste is much more full flavoured than previous cups. This is an [[Improvement]], and I'll try the inverted only going forward. Very [[Good]] taste, and and *very close* to [[Excellent]] cup ... definitely in comparison to the last few days.

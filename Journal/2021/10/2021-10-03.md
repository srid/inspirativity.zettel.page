- Trying [[Aeropress/Inverted Method]] for [[Yirgacheffe]] and increased [[Comandante]] grind dial to 18 (from 15[^1]), which lead to a more pronounced [[Aroma]] during grind incidentally -- as well as increased the [[Brew Time]] from the usual 1:25 to 2:25 minutes (as well as used a [[Thermometer]] to measure [[Water Temperature]] at 185f) -- and the taste is much more full flavoured than previous cups. This is an [[Improvement]], and I'll try the inverted only going forward. Very [[Good]] taste, and and *very close* to [[Excellent]] cup ... definitely in comparison to the last few days.

[^1]: assuming I remember the last one correctly; see the [[2021-09-18]] misdial note

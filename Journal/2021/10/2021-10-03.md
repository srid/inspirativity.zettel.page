- Trying [[Aeropress/Inverted Method]] for [[Yirgacheffe]] and increased [[Comandante]] grind dial to 18 (from 15) (assuming I remember the last one correctyl), and the taste is much more full flavoured than previous cups. This is an [[Improvement]], and I'll try the inverted only going forward. [[Good]] taste

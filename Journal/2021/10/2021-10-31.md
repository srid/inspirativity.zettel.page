- A [[Fault]] with [[Comandante]] is that sometimes (tiny broken) beans can get stuck in the top hole, leading to improper grinding mechanism ... wherein one loses control and the lid flips open, with the revolving momentum thrusting a few beans out on to the floor. One just has to make sure that the top hole remains clear before grinding.

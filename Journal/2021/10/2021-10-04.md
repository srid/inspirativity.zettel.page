- [[Yirgacheffe]] on [[Inverted Method]]: increased grind size to 19, [[Water Temperature]] at 192f, [[Brew Time]] 2:00. Slight [[Improvement]] compared to yesterday, I think - but as I finish drinking the cup I'd say it is [[Excellent]] (more of [[Dark Chocolate]] coming through) and is teetering on the edge of being perfect.

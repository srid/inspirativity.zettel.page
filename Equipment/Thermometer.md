A digital meat thermometer with probe, like [this](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B017613C3C/), can be used to measure the [[Water Temperature]] in real-time while it heats up on a stove-top [[Kettle]] with a steam hole[^hole].

[^hole]: Just [**do not**]{.text-red-600} let it reach boiling temperature with the hole blocked!

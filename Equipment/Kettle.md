slug: kettle

I use [this](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B074QMPSTC/) 0.5L gooseneck kettle for stove-top heating. It has a small hole on to which I insert the [[Thermometer]] probe. Once the desired [[Water Temperature]] is achieved, I either turn off the stove or turn down the heat to the minimal intensity required to *keep* the water at that temperature, all the while I measure and grind the beans in the [[Comandante]].

The handle gets hot if you are not careful enough not to place it at the edges of the stove.
